# Magma:
Magma is a modern terminal designed from the ground up to work around Vulkan hardware acceleration. While we may support both software and OpenGL as fall back methods our primary and preferred render method is going to be Vulkan.

# BEWARE HERE LIE ERRORS:
This is early dev code and my laptop is kinda dying randomly I don't want to lose I don't normally like pushing such bad code but I'd rather not lose this work. Some flaws are knowen like the font's being a mess and the fact the terminal is writing to a raw char buffer that can easily be overflowed but again I don't want to lose my work. So bad code ahead.

# How to build it:
Currently we use the make build system while the build is still fairly simple however we may move to meson/cmake should the build process become more complex
```sh
    make
```

# How to run it:
- Honestly You really shouldn't right now it's in early development
